# Muser

### Spotify with Song Review Functionality

Muser is currently undergoing a refactor with the following improvements:

* I am changing the Server-Side Rendering templates to a React frontend, with a UI that matches Spotify's.
* I am adding an external Flask server to run K-means clustering for converting a user image into a suitable background color.
